# Message Routing

Message routing is one of the most fundamental requirements when integrating systems/services. It considers content-based routing, header-based routing, rules-based routing, and policy-based routing as ways of routing a message. WSO2 Micro Integrator enables these routing capabilities using the concepts of mediators and endpoints.

The following image depicts a form of message routing where a message is routed through the Micro Integrator to the appropriate service. In this case, the Switch/Send mediator can be used.
