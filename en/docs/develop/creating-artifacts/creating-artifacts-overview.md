# Integration Artifacts Overview

Once you create an integration project, you can add integration artifacts and create the integration flow.

The following are the artifacts that can be added to an integration flow:

| [**API**]({{base_path}}/develop/creating-artifacts/creating-an-api)                                  | An endpoint with a URL, specifying the context and resources accessible through HTTP methods such as `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, and `DELETE`. When a request is arrived, it is processed by the input sequence (`inSequence`) of the API, where the Micro Integrator uses mediators to process the message and forward it to the backend service. Upon receiving the response from the backend, the same `inSequence` or a designated `faultSequence` (in case of errors) processes the response and forwards it to the client, ensuring a streamlined flow of messages without the need for an output sequence. |
| [**Endpoint**]({{base_path}}/develop/creating-artifacts/creating-endpoints)                          | Defines external reference points for sending out messages from the integration server to external services or APIs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [**Sequence**]({{base_path}}/develop/creating-artifacts/creating-reusable-sequences)                 | A reusable set of mediation instructions that processes incoming or outgoing messages. Sequences are used in the proxy service and the REST APIs. Each sequence is a set of mediators where messages are processed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [**Proxy Service**]({{base_path}}/develop/creating-artifacts/creating-a-proxy-service)               | Acts as an intermediary that accepts client requests, optionally applies mediation logic through sequences, and routes them to external services or internal components for processing, thereby decoupling the client and backend service endpoints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [**Message Store**]({{base_path}}/develop/creating-artifacts/creating-a-message-store)               | Temporarily stores messages that are processed asynchronously, allowing for reliable messaging and delayed processing. The delivery of a message to the endpoint can be guaranteed with this, since it is only deleted from the Store when an endpoint receives the message correctly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [**Message Processor**]({{base_path}}/develop/creating-artifacts/creating-a-message-processor)       | Handles the processing of messages stored in message stores, managing the delivery of messages to endpoints based on specific conditions or schedules. The message processor extracts a queue, memory or database from it and sends it to an endpoint.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [**Task**]({{base_path}}/develop/creating-artifacts/creating-scheduled-task)                         | A scheduled job that executes specific logic at predefined intervals to automate integration workflows. Tasks can also be customized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [**Local Entry**]({{base_path}}/develop/creating-artifacts/registry/creating-local-registry-entries) | Static configurations stored locally within the server, used to define simple values or XML configurations that can be referenced within synapse configurations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [**Template**]({{base_path}}/develop/creating-artifacts/creating-endpoint-templates)                 | A reusable configurations that can be parameterized and applied to multiple integration scenarios to promote reusability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [**Data Service**]({{base_path}}/develop/creating-artifacts/data-services/creating-data-services)    | A deployable artifact that exposes data operations as web services, allowing for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on underlying data sources through SOAP or RESTful APIs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [**Data Source**]({{base_path}}/develop/creating-artifacts/data-services/creating-datasources)       | A configuration element that defines the connection details to a database, enabling the Micro Integrator to interact with it for data operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 
| [**Class Mediator**]({{base_path}}/develop/customizations/creating-custom-mediators)                 | A custom Java class that implements the `org.apache.synapse.Mediator` interface, allowing developers to execute custom logic within the flow of a Synapse configuration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
