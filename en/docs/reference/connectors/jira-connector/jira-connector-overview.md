# Jira Connector Overview

The JIRA Connector allows you to connect to JIRA, which is an online issue-tracking database. The connector uses the JIRA REST API to connect to JIRA, view and update issues, work with filters, and more.

Go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://store.wso2.com/connector/esb-connector-jira">WSO2 Connector Store</a> to download the Jira connector.
