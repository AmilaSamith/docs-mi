# MongoDB Connector Overview

The MongoDB Connector allows you to connect to the MongoDB database via different connection URI and perform CRUD operations on the database.

The supported connection URI types and connection options are listed in the [MongoDB Connection String](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/) documentation.
