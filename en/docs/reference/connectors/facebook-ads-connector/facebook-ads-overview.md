# Facebook Ads Connector Overview

Facebook Ads are customizable advertising units that allow businesses to reach their target audience on Facebook and its associated platforms. These ads can be tailored with various formats, targeting options, and budget settings.

The Facebook Ads Connector allows you to access the Facebook Marketing API. This lets you create, update, and delete ad campaigns and ads.
